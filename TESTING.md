### User Story Testing

* #### As a customer:

  **General**
    * I can view a menu so that I can see what food is available.
        * The view menu button on the homepage launches the menu for the user to view.
    * I can see a map of the restaurant location so that I can easily find the restaurant.
        * The location section of the homepage provides the address of the restaurant and a map of the location.

  **Bookings**
    * I can easily specify a date and time for a booking so that I can quickly book a table for when I want it.
        * The booking form includes an easy to use date and time input.
    * I can easily specify the size of my party for a booking so that I can ensure I book a table of the correct size.
        * The booking form includes an easy to use party size dropdown input.
    * I can detail special or dietary requirements when I book so that I can inform the restaurant.
        * The booking form includes an optional special requirements input.
    * I can see whether a table is available at my specified booking time so that I can confirm my booking straight
      away.
        * The booking form shows a validation error if no tables are available. The booking confirmation page confirms
          that a table is available and the table is booked instantly.
    * I can receive an email with my booking details so that I can have a reminder of the details of my booking.
        * A booking confirmation email is sent out when a booking is made.
    * I can register for an account so that I can review or change my bookings.
        * Account registration has been added to the site.

* #### As a registered customer:

  **Bookings**
    * I can view a list of bookings I have made so that I can easily select and update the individual booking
      information.
        * The my bookings page shows cards of the users upcoming bookings with links to update or cancel the booking.
    * I can view and amend bookings I have made so that I can change the information as required.
        * The update booking page allows users to see and amend their booking details as required.
    * I can view and cancel a booking I have made so that I can easily let the restaurant know I won't be attending.
        * A booking can be cancelled from the my bookings page. A warning confirmation modal is launched to ensure that
          the cancel link was not selected in error.
    * I can save my personal information so that I can save time when booking in the future.
        * The decision has been made to not implement this user story in this iteration however it could be implemented
          in the future.

* #### As a restaurant owner:

  **Restaurant**
    * I can set the opening and closing times of my restaurant so that bookings will only be made when the restaurant is
      open.
        * The opening and closing times of the restaurant can be changed in the admin panel and these are used in the
          booking system to define the slots.
    * I can view, add, update or remove tables from the booking system so that I can ensure the correct number of tables
      available for booking.
        * Tables can be added or deleted in the admin panel.

  **Bookings**
    * I can view a list of table bookings so that I can see how many customers will be visiting each day.
        * The manage bookings page provides the restaurant owner with a list of upcoming bookings with those for the
          current day at the top.
    * I can view my customers' special requirements so that I can respond accordingly.
        * The manage bookings and booking detail pages both list the booking special requirements.
    * I can assign a restaurant table number to the customer bookings so that I can plan the seating in my restaurant.
        * The table number input on the manage bookings and booking detail pages allows the restaurant owner to add
          their own table numbers to the bookings.
    * I can view, update or cancel bookings so that I can manage the daily bookings.
        * The manage bookings page provides the option to View booking details, update or cancel bookings. The cancel
          confirmation modal ensures that cancel has not been selected accidently.
    * I can see when a customer has made or updated a booking so that I can review the information.
        * The updated flag displays on bookings on the manage bookings page when the booking has been created or updated
          by a customer ensuring that the restaurant owner is aware of any changes.

### Validator Testing

* HTML
    * All pages have been passed through the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) using URI input. An initial
      check flagged two spurious end tags and some issues with the iframe styles. These problems have been corrected.
    * No errors are now returned for all pages.
* CSS
    * All pages have been passed through the [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) using URI input
      and the CSS file has also been passed through using direct input.
    * No errors have been found for all pages.
* JS
    * The Javascript snippets have been passed through
      the [Beautify Tools](https://beautifytools.com/javascript-validator.php) validator. The bootstrap alert on the
      timeout function is flagged as not defined but is defined elsewhere.
    * No other errors have been found.
* Python
    * All Python files have been passed through the [PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/) check with no errors flagged.
    * The Gitpod built in linter has also been used throughout development to improve the Python code through the
      shortening of lines and addition of docstrings.

### Fixed Bugs

* During the development process it was discovered that the booking end_time did not update when the booking was
  updated. This was fixed by ensuring the end time is calculated on every save.
* The footer was not originally fixed to the bottom of the page on pages with little content for example the manage
  bookings page with no bookings. CSS for a sticky footer was added.
* On a review of the site a spurious sign out button was noted on the logout page. This has been removed.
